    <h2>Elon’s Exploitation</h2>
    <p>
      From apartheid-era South Africa to the corporate tech elite, Elon Musk’s legacy is one of extraction and control. His family benefited from a system built on racial segregation and economic oppression. Today, those same patterns show up in Tesla’s union busting, racial discrimination lawsuits, and disregard for worker safety.

    <h2>Apartheid Roots</h2>
    <p>
      Apartheid wasn’t just a system of segregation — it was a violent regime designed to keep power in the hands of a white minority. Elon grew up within that structure, with access to privilege most of the country was denied. Understanding this context is crucial to understanding how he wields power today.

    <h2>Memphis: A City Already Fighting</h2>
    <p>
      Memphis has long battled environmental injustice — oil pipelines, toxic waste, poor air quality. Black and working-class communities have paid the price. Now, a massive data center threatens to strain our water and energy while providing zero benefit to the people.
