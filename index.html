      <h2>Elon’s Exploitation</h2>
      <p>
        Elon Musk’s rise to prominence is deeply rooted in systems of exploitation and unchecked capitalism. His family reportedly benefited financially during apartheid in South Africa, a system designed to enforce racial and economic segregation. Fast forward to today, Musk’s companies have faced multiple lawsuits over racial discrimination and unsafe working conditions. Tesla’s union-busting efforts have drawn national scrutiny, and workers have documented extensive injuries and suppressed labor rights. Musk’s approach to business reflects a broader trend of tech billionaires leveraging deregulation, tax avoidance, and anti-union strategies to increase profits at the cost of human wellbeing.

      <h2>Apartheid Roots</h2>
      <p>
        Apartheid in South Africa was a brutal regime that legally codified racial hierarchy and ensured the dominance of a white minority over the Black majority. Elon Musk was born into a white family with access to privilege, elite education, and business opportunities under this system. His father owned an emerald mine, and while the extent of Elon’s benefit from this wealth is debated, it is clear he was not subject to the violence and economic marginalization experienced by the vast majority of South Africans. This background has been largely unaddressed in mainstream tech narratives, yet it offers critical context to how Musk views hierarchy, control, and power.

      <h2>Memphis: A City Already Fighting</h2>
      <p>
        Memphis has a long legacy of environmental injustice, where historically Black and working-class communities have been repeatedly exposed to industrial pollution, toxic waste sites, and unsafe air and water. From the Byhalia Pipeline fight to current issues with lead in water infrastructure, residents have mobilized to protect their health and homes. Now, with the proposed xAI supercomputer facility burning methane on-site, South Memphis faces another existential threat. The project risks elevating air pollution and straining already limited resources, while promising no direct community benefits in return. Local leadership’s silence or complicity raises critical questions about who is being protected—and who is being sacrificed.

We are organizing to demand transparency, accountability, and meaningful protections for the people of Memphis.
