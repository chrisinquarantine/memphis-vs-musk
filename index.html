      <h2>Who are we?</h2>
      <p>
        We are the Tigers against pollution! T.A.P for short. We are (but not limited to) a group of university students who have chosen to lead a fight against a great evil. The evils of capitalistic greed, unscrupulous business practice, and systematic injustice. Starting from only a few, We have come together to create a coalition of powerful individuals of all ethnicities, ages, genders, and backgrounds who see these evils, and choose to fight.

      <h2>Roots of Exploitation</h2>
      <p>
        Elon Muskâ€™s rise to prominence is deeply rooted in systems of exploitation and unchecked capitalism. From South Africa, to Texas, to Boca Chica, Elon musk and other likeminded white supremacist individuals have trampled over many indigenous communities as means to fill their pockets. 
        Starting with his actions in Texas, Tesla's Gigafactory in Austin Texas has faced multiple environmental violations, including air pollution and improper hazardous waste disposal. Reports indicate that untreated wastewater entered the city's sewer system, and employees were allegedly instructed to mislead regulators during inspections. These actions have drawn scrutiny from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) and Austin Water. 
        Similarly, in Boca Chica, SpaceX's Starbase facility has been discharging massive amounts of water. Up to 358,000 gallons per launch (sound familiar?), into nearby wetlands using a deluge system to cool its launchpad. The EPA cited SpaceX for operating this system without the necessary permits (once again, sound familiar?), leading to a $148,378 fine. Despite warnings, the company continued its launches, prompting lawsuits from environmental groups and the Carrizo Comecrudo Tribe of Texas, who state that these actions violate the Clean Water Act and threaten local ecosystems and public health. 
        Lastly, The Apartheid in South Africa was a brutal regime that legally established racial hierarchy from 1940 to the early 1990s. The white minority descendants of Dutch and British colonizers built a regime where Black South Africans had almost no rights. They were forced into poor, overcrowded areas, denied quality education, jobs, and political power, and constantly monitored and brutalized by police. One form of labor they were forced into, was working in uranium mines, which are highly radioactive. They would work in these mines, not properly educated on the radioactivity and its adverse affects to their health, while the white minority lived on hills, to avoid the radioactivity from these areas. After the proposition of a land redistrubution act (meant to help heal the wage gap between those white minority and african american neo-slaves), propoganda has been released by the US GOVERNMENT, calling the act "racism towards white people." Elon was born and raised in this environment, his family profiting off the discrimination in the area. Does this sound like someone Memphis can trust?
